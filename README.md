## Getting Started
- The directory 'vibration' has the main source code to conduct vibration analysis.
- See 'vibration/vibration_start.R' to conduct a sample vibration analysis to get started.
- Data is located in the R data structure: 'nhanes99_04.Rdata'
- For tables, figures for "Empirical assessment of the vibration of effects due to model specification in observational associations: a primer", see the ./jce_results/ directory
